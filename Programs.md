## QFitsView2 (Ott 2012)

It has all the features (and possible more), but it is **pre-compiled**.

## PINGSOF (Rosales-Ortega 2011)

It is written in **IDL** requiring an expensive license

## CubeViz (Ferguson 2019)

It is a visualisation and analysis toolbox for data cubes. It is designed to work with data cubes from the NIRSpec and MIRI instruments on JWST: https://cubeviz.readthedocs.io/en/0.3.0/index.html#
**If it can work with any IFU, it is a problem**

## MPDAF (Bacon et al. 2016)

The MUSE Python Data Analysis Framework. It has been developed and used in the MUSE Consortium for several years, and is available freely for the community: https://mpdaf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
**It is not interactive**

## MARVIN (Cherinka et al. 2019, https://www.sdss.org/dr15/manga/marvin/)

It is a complete ecosystem designed for overcoming the challenge of searching, accessing, and visualizing the MaNGA data.  It is designed **only for MaNGA data**

## Mapviewer  from GIST (Bittner et al. 2019)

It doesn't allow to visualize only the input data. **You have to run GIST** and analyse kinematics/stellar populations



# Advantage of our program:

1. It is simple
2. It is written in Python 
3. It is interactive 
4. It is not specific
